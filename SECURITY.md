## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within AudioMaster, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.
2. Send a detailed report to [security@audiomaster.example.com](mailto:security@audiomaster.example.com).
3. Expect an acknowledgment within 24 hours.
4. Allow up to 72 hours for an initial assessment.
5. We will keep you informed of the progress.

### Report Format

Please include:

- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fixes (if any)

## Security Measures

### Audio Data Protection

- No audio data is stored permanently without explicit user consent
- Audio buffers are securely cleared after use

### User Privacy
- No audio recording without explicit permission
- Clear indication when audio is being processed
- No data collection beyond essential functionality

### System Security
- Secure boot verification
- Runtime integrity checks
- Memory sanitization
- Buffer overflow protection
- Git secrets scanning and prevention
  - Pre-commit hooks for sensitive data detection
  - Custom patterns for project-specific secrets
  - Automated scanning of git history
  - AWS credential detection

Date: September 15, 2025

### Critical Findings and Recommendations

#### 1. Remote Build Process
**Current Risks:**
- Unencrypted file transfer during rsync operations
- Plain text SSH command usage
- Missing build artifact signature verification
- Limited build server authentication

**Recommendations:**
- Implement TLS 1.3 encryption for file transfers
- Add build artifact code signing and verification
- Implement SHA-256 checksum verification
- Enhance build server authentication mechanisms

#### 2. Audio Processing Security
**Current Risks:**
- Potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Memory management concerns in audio routing
- Insufficient device input validation
- Possible feedback loop vulnerabilities

**Recommendations:**
- Implement secure buffer allocation with automatic cleanup
- Add comprehensive input validation for audio data
- Implement secure memory handling for audio buffers
- Add feedback loop detection and prevention

#### 3. Version Control Security
**Current Implementation:**
- Git-secrets scanning with pre-commit hooks
- Custom pattern detection for project-specific secrets
- Automated repository history scanning
- Audio file commit warnings

**Remaining Risks:**
- Unprotected build metadata
- Version number integrity concerns
- Unsigned git tags

**Additional Recommendations:**
- Add cryptographic signing for git tags (pending)
- Secure build metadata handling (pending)
- Implement version number verification (pending)

**Mitigation Status:**
- ✅ Git-secrets scanning implemented
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks configured
- ✅ Custom security patterns defined
- ❌ Tag signing not yet implemented

#### 4. Build System Security
**Current Risks:**
- Insecure temporary file handling
- Unsigned build artifacts
- Non-reproducible builds
- Unprotected build logs

**Recommendations:**
- Implement deterministic build processes
- Add build artifact signing
- Enhance temporary file security
- Implement secure log handling

### Required Actions

1. **Immediate Priority:**
   - Implement build artifact signing
   - ✅ Add secure memory handling for audio processing (implemented via SecureAudioBuffer)
   - Enable TLS 1.3 for all network communications
   - ✅ Implement comprehensive permission system (audio permissions and buffer access)
   - ✅ Implement git-secrets scanning (completed with pre-commit hooks)

2. **Short-term (30 days):**
   - Complete implementation of audit logging
   - ✅ Enhance error handling security (implemented with AudioError improvements)
   - Implement secure configuration storage
   - ✅ Add runtime verification systems (implemented in audio buffer handling)

3. **Medium-term (90 days):**
   - Implement reproducible builds
   - Enhance certificate pinning
   - Add advanced threat detection
   - Implement secure update mechanism
