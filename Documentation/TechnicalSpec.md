# AudioMaster Technical Documentation

## Overview
AudioMaster is an advanced audio interface management system for iPad Air (4th Gen), designed to overcome iPadOS audio routing limitations and provide professional-grade audio control.

## Core Components

### AudioInterfaceManager
The central component managing audio routing and device interactions.

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Audio session configuration
- Device detection and routing
- Multi-output management
- State management and recovery

#### Performance Characteristics:
- Target Latency: < 5ms
- CPU Usage: < 30% under normal conditions
- Memory Footprint: < 50MB

### FeedbackPrevention System

#### Detection Algorithm
The feedback prevention system uses a multi-stage approach:
1. Real-time peak detection using vDSP
2. Frequency analysis for sustained feedback patterns
3. Multi-channel correlation analysis

#### Prevention Strategies
- Adaptive gain reduction
- Channel-specific muting
- Smart routing changes

#### Performance Metrics
- Detection Time: < 1ms
- False Positive Rate: < 0.1%
- Prevention Response Time: < 2ms

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Component isolation tests
- Error handling validation
- State management verification

#### Performance Tests
- Latency measurements
- CPU usage monitoring
- Memory allocation tracking
- Real-time processing validation

#### Integration Tests
- Device interaction testing
- Route change handling
- Multi-output scenarios

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error management using `AudioError` enum with:
- Detailed error descriptions
- Recovery suggestions
- Logging integration

### Logging System
Structured logging using os.log with:
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Route change history
- Feedback incidents

## Best Practices

### Audio Processing
- Use circular buffers for continuous processing
- Implement lock-free algorithms where possible
- Maintain consistent buffer sizes
- Monitor for buffer underruns

### Testing
- Run performance tests on target device
- Test with various audio interfaces
- Validate multi-channel scenarios
- Monitor memory usage patterns

### Debugging
- Use Time Profiler for performance issues
- Monitor Audio Engine graphs
- Track route changes in real-time
- Analyze feedback patterns

## Future Considerations
1. Support for aggregate devices
2. Enhanced feedback prevention algorithms
3. Custom audio processing plugins
4. Remote monitoring capabilities
