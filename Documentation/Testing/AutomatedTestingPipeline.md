# Automated Testing Pipeline

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
test:
  runs-on: macos-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Select Xcode
      uses: maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@v1
      with:
        xcode-version: latest-stable
    
    - name: Run Tests
      run: |
        xcodebuild test \
          -project AudioMaster.xcodeproj \
          -scheme AudioMaster \
          -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Air (4th generation)' \
          -enableCodeCoverage YES
    
    - name: Upload Test Results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: test-results
        path: build/reports

    - name: Process Coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Test Reporting

### Required Metrics
1. Test pass/fail rate
2. Code coverage
3. Performance metrics
4. Regression indicators

### Report Format
```json
{
  "testSuite": "AudioMasterTests",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-15T10:00:00Z",
  "results": {
    "total": 100,
    "passed": 98,
    "failed": 2,
    "skipped": 0
  },
  "performance": {
    "audioLatency": "4.2ms",
    "cpuUsage": "28%",
    "memoryUsage": "45MB"
  },
  "coverage": {
    "total": "94%",
    "critical": "100%",
    "ui": "92%"
  }
}
```

## Automated Checks

### Pre-merge Requirements
- All tests pass
- Coverage thresholds met
- Performance benchmarks within limits
- No new warnings

### Post-deployment Validation
- Integration tests
- Real device testing
- Extended performance monitoring

## Failure Response Protocol

1. Immediate notification to team
2. Automatic issue creation
3. Performance regression tracking
4. Root cause analysis requirement

## Schedule

### Automated Tests
- On every PR: Unit tests, UI tests
- Nightly: Full test suite
- Weekly: Extended performance tests

### Manual Tests
- Pre-release: Hardware compatibility
- Monthly: Accessibility audit
- Quarterly: Full UX review
